As Election Day draws near I've noticed a stark difference between this election
and those of years past. During the Republican primaries support for Trump among
conservatives swirled in the 10-15% range. After he won he managed to secure the
votes of many in the remaining 85%. That's a fairly remarkable feat considering that
the Republican party, who have long since proclaimed themselves the party of the
family, selected a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, ignoramus as their
candidate for president.

The liberal progressive reaction after Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic
primary race has seemed to be the opposite. The media describe this lack of
support among younger voters as an "enthusiam gap" or "millenial cynicism" of
the political system and Hillary Clinton. It's not hard to imagine that people
who came into adulthood during the great recession would be less than thrilled
at the prospect of a president who's been bankrolled by Wall Street and who
supported the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria.

One interesting commonality of those who feel betrayed by their preferred
political party has been their preference of casting a protest vote for a third
party. This isn't by any means a new phonomenon but I thought it might be best
to shed some light on why I think that protest votes are not only a distraction
but extremely dangerous.

# Duverger's Law

In the US presidential elections we use a [first pass the post][fptp] plural
voting system. That is, one vote per voter for a single candidate. After all votes
are cast the majority [usually][2000_election] wins. A side effect of this type
of plural voting system is [Duverger's Law][duverger], which states that these
types of plural voting systems favor a two party political system. We've seen
this in effect for quite a long time. You have to go back all the way to 1865,
when Andrew Johnson won the presidency as a National Union party member, to find
a president that wasn't either a Republican or Democrat. The conclusion we can
draw here is that the next president of the United States will be Republican or
Democrat.

# Lesser of Two Evils

Even if you don't want either of the major party candidates to win you must think
that one is worse that the other.

Because either a Republican or Democrat will win, by voting for a third party
candidate instead of voting against the worst major party candidate, you are
making it more likely that least desireable of the realistically electable
candidates will win. A vote for a third party does nothing but increase the
the likelyhood of the worst possible outcome.

# Preferential Voting

While our existing plural voting system will always favor two parties there could
be some light at the end of the tunnel. [Ranked-Choice voting][rcv] is a voting
system that allows you to rank your choice of candidates from most preferred to
least preferred. Votes are tallied in a way that effectively lets you vote for
your third party candidate while ensuring that the worst possible outcome is not
a threat. Some cities and states have adopted this style of voting already.

The only way out of our existing system is to change it. That'll require a
constitutional amendment. Rather than focusing on casting a protest vote, vote for
the lesser of two evils and spend your time trying to elect local congressional
leaders that favor preferential voting.
