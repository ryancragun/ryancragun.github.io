Ryan Cragun is a programmer, sysadmin, and consultant by day. At night you'll
find him philosophizing with his fianc√©, hanging out with his dogs, snobbing
about Portland beer, doing various outdoorsy things and writing blog
descriptions about himself in the 3rd person.

The words and opinions on this blog are his own and not his employers.
